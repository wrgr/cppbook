## Introduction

*“Just keep swimming.”
~ Dory, Finding Nemo*

College Prep consists of various activities designed to get you prepared for your college applications, college life, and your future career.  During the summer, we will have a mix of different activities, designed to keep things interesting and fun.  Many assignments will be completed as part of small teams, which is similar to group work in college and engineering and science projects in the “real-world.”  Be sure not to let your teammates down!

Everyone who you meet in CPP is a volunteer who has given up their Saturday to teach and mentor you.  You and your classmates were selected from a very competitive pool to attend this summer’s program.  Work hard, have fun, and do your best!!!

We think of you as little brothers and sisters and will do everything we can to help you achieve your dreams!

**How to excel in CPP:**

- Don’t miss class
- Do all your assignments on time
- Come to class with a positive attitude ready
- Work hard
- Check email and the webapp daily!

## Class Companion

Welcome to the College Prep Program Class Companion (Version 0.5)

Welcome to CPP! This class companion will be your guide through the summer College Prep course. You can expect to work hard, have fun, learn a lot, and make lasting friendships. Congratulations on being admitted, and on beginning this next phase of your journey!
This workbook is a guide to most of the materials and activities that we will cover during the summer, including each homework assignment, and many of the presentations and class materials. Our workbook is still a work in progress, so please let us know what you think, and how we can make it better!
The specific homework for each week will be assigned in class, and will always be available in the `Webapp <cppapp.org>`_.  The Webapp is considered to be the landing page for CPP students; we expect you to check regularly (at least once per day!!)  

Detailed instructions for every assignment can be found in this book. The different assignments and class activities are divided into modules.

**This class companion is still under active development - check back often for updates.  In particular, assignment guides for future weeks, financial aid, and resources are not yet complete.**

## Modules

### CPP Core

This includes several topics, including how to go to college, how to complete a winning application, how to write compelling essays, how to pay for college, and where to apply.  We also cover techniques such as study skills and time management.

### SAT Course

During the summer, you will complete an intensive SAT Prep course as part of CPP.  SAT is a significant part of your CPP experience, and you must complete ALL SAT assignments during the summer in order to be eligible for College Prep Graduation.  Specific rules are explained in the SAT section.  All the hard work is worth it â€“ if you work hard, we expect that your scores will improve dramatically â€“ the harder you work, the more improvement you will see.  Some students see improvements of more than 500 points by the time they apply to college!

### Mentoring


"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn."
~ Benjamin Franklin

#### Good Mentor

You should know the purpose of a mentor and what to expect from your CPP mentor. An important role of your mentor is to expand your vision. Your mentor will help you to dream big and to see what you cannot see in yourself. For example, if you are an â€œAâ€ student, and thinking about getting a job after completing high school, your mentor can help you see beyond that job. Your mentor can expand your thinking to see a much bigger reward following a college education. Also, your mentor can show you how to prepare for college, succeed in college, and reach your goals. Your mentor has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and will take a personal interest in helping you succeed. At any given time, your mentor can be one of the following:

- Sponsor: expose the mentee to new things.
- Teacher: help solve problems and create learning opportunities.
- Coach: help you to accomplish your goals.
- Protector: provides a safe environment for you to practice and develop new skills.
- Counselor: boost your self-esteem through encouraging discussions.
- Role model: demonstrate the behaviors necessary for success.

Remember the CPP mentors are here for you.  They are very excited to help you achieve your goals.  If you want to know something, just ask.

### Good Mentee

Having a mentor can help you to learn how to be prepared for college and beyond. Your mentor will connect you with people and skills that you need in order to succeed in college. Your mentor may provide advice on how to handle different situations (e.g., time management, study skills, interviewing, and home sickness). Your mentor will draw from their own experience to share awareness, wisdom, and knowledge. Your mentor will support positive change in your life and will challenge your thinking, thereby expanding the possibilities for you.
However, you will not automatically receive these benefits of the CPP mentoring relationship. Experienced mentees know to have the relationship they want, much depends on them. As a CPP mentee, the success of the mentoring relationship depends on you. You are in control of your own development.
If you are serious about learning from your mentor, your frame of mind will be I am here to learn, and I am open to new ideas. I am responsible for my own life and for making my own development and career path happen.
Below, you will find tips on how to get the most from your mentoring sessions.

*Tips for Mentees*

- Be prepared for your mentoring sessions.
- Let your mentor know who you are.
- Focus on the relationship, rather than outcomes.
- Ask direct questions about what you most want to know.
- Practice learning from anyone.
- Listen with an open mind.
- Ask curious questions.
- Take notes.
- Provide brief updates to help your mentor to understand you.
- Respect your mentor's boundaries.
- Follow up on agreements.
- Say Thank You!

## Technology

### Webapp

Along with this class companion, the CPP Webapp is your main portal to all the resources youâ€™ll need. The most updated program information will reside on this Webapp. This web portal will allows you to download and upload core homework assignments, complete SAT tests and quizzes, track your current progress and stay connected with your classmate through the forum. It is required that you visit the Webapp at least once a day to keep up with the latest information.

We will help by providing tools and instructions to help you with the process.  This will help you get used to a lot of the technology you will use once enrolled in college, and will also help us to review your materials.  The site is private to us.  You will authenticate with your google account.

#### Where to Go for Help

If you are experiencing technical difficulty, please email to get the issue resolved.  In your email, please be specific and describe your issue in details.

Here are a few tips to help you avoid potential issues:

2.	Be patient, at times the Webapp can be slow.
3.	If you are having trouble accessing the Webapp, the first thing you should do is to refresh on your browser.
4.  Don't wait until the last minute to submit your assignments, start early!

#### Required Technology

Regular access to a computer, graphing calculator, internet, and email are required to participate in College Prep.  We can help!  If you don't have these items, please let us know as soon as possible, and we will provide them for you to use during CPP!
**Check Email Daily.**  Most assignments and worksheets will be completed electronically.  We are requiring all students to use CPP provided chromebooks as a pilot.  Your feedback will be solicited at the end of summer.

### Classroom rules

- #1: You will be treated like college students!
- There are no excused absences.  Attend every class: if you miss any classes you may be dismissed from the program
- You must stay up with your assignments; if you fall behind, you may be asked to catch up and miss other class activities.  If you fall too far behind, you may be dismissed from the program.
- Arrive on time between 8:30 and 8:45am. Arriving late will result in a tardy (3 tardies = 1 absence)
- No cellphones are allowed in class
- Food/drinks are allowed; bring your lunch each day
- Work hard to complete all assignments - if you do all the work, you will be way ahead of most of your classmates in applying to college!
- Do your best and work hard.  CPP is taught totally by volunteers who want to help you succeed!
- College Prep is experimental; therefore all rules may be modified as needed by the Program Directors (Will and Karla).  

*Set big dreams and goals - so far, nearly all of the students who have finished the CPP program have gone on to college!*

### Honor Code

You are encouraged to discuss assignments with other students, mentors, teachers, parents, etc.  In fact, review by others is essential to submitting your best, polished materials to colleges.  However, the materials you submit must be your own, and you will have to certify that this is true on each application.  

As an example, for your essays, you may get feedback or suggestions on topics to write about, and feedback on grammar.  You may not use sentences (or sentence fragments), that were written by others.  This applies to direct use of material as well as paraphrased statements.  If you don’t understand this, please ask – there can be really serious consequences to plagiarizing or exaggerating your accomplishments.

**As Madison Sarratt (a Dean at Vanderbilt) famously said:  “Today I am going to give you two examinations, one in trigonometry and one in honesty. I hope you will pass them both, but if you must fail one, let it be trigonometry, for there are many good [people] in this world today who cannot pass an examination in trigonometry, but there are no good [people] in the world who cannot pass an examination in honesty.”**

We expect that work you submit was not authored by, or copied from, another student.  This includes any materials found on the internet.

### Points

Points are awarded for assignment completion and effort, not for correctness.  It is our hope that everyone will graduate - this is a collaborative effort.  So if you see someone falling behind, please help!

To graduate, ALL assignments must be completed.  We record points in the WebApp as follows:

- Green:  Complete, and on time:  1 point
- Yellow: Complete, but originally incomplete or late:  0 points (but counted toward graduation)
- Red:  Turned in, but currently incomplete and late:  0 points (recommend fixing as soon as possible)

Approximately 65% of points come from homework, 25% from SAT assignments, and the remainder from class participation.  Class participation points are granted automatically or through the completion of an activity during CPP classes or events.  
Although we don't expect this to happen, if you miss or fail to actively participate in an activity (like missing a mentor session or falling asleep during a field trip), you will be assigned negative points that will count against your total (even if that particular activity does not have points associated with it).

#### Due dates

- SAT Assignments are due by 9a on the date specified in the WebApp.
- Core Assignments are due by noon on the date specified in the WebApp.
- Self-Reflection assignments are due by 5pm on the date specified in the WebApp to allow you to reflect!

Late credit is typically not available except in extremely unusual circumstances.  Please reach out if you need help!

#### Graduation

In order to graduate from CPP and earn an Achievement Award, you must do three things:
-	Meet attendance requirements
-	Earn at least 87% of the total points (100/115).  Bonus points may be used to meet this total, but all core information still needs to be completed.
- A minimum of 80% of the total points for graduation (92/115) must be earned from core assignments.

-	Complete all assignments
-	Submit a final, completed CPP portfolio
-	Complete post-program survey (on Google Forms)

Additional award requirements and opportunties will be announced during the program.
**Final graduation determinations are made by CPP Directors.**

#### Student Awards

Students can earn several program awards - others may be given at the discretion of the instructors:

- Achievement Award (Graduation): Students earning at least 90 points (90%), with no absences and a completed Final Portfolio
- Exceptional Achievement Award: Students earning at least 100 points (100%), with no absences and a completed Final Portfolio.  Plus nominations from mentors and CPP leadership.
- Perfect Attendance Award: Students attending every class, with less than 3 tardies.
- DRMS Award: Top Student, based on points, hard work, participation, and instructor, mentor, and coach input.

Additionally, all students are required to:

- Complete all assignments
- Submit a final, completed CPP portfolio
- Complete post-program survey (on Google Forms)

*CPP Leadership reserves the right to modify any of these awards, at their discretion*

### Portfolio

As a **graduation requirement**, each student will assembly their work from the summer into a final portfolio.  This document will contain key information about yourself, including most of the information needed for your college applications.

**General** – your portfolio should include most of the information needed for your college application. This should capture all the work you have done during College Prep (all assignments) and your experiences during the summer. The outline provided below is the minimum requirement and a starting point. To make the most out of what you’ve learned throughout the summer, you are required to provide additional topics that are not included within this outline.  Please include any assignments that we missed in the template! Creativity is highly encouraged as you put together your portfolio. Please be descriptive as you provide answers for additional information requested in the outline; as always, one sentence responses are not acceptable. As a general rule, think 1-2 paragraph minimum answers.  :)

**Organization/Format** – your portfolio should be professional and easy to navigate, and each section should have a heading.  Be sure to provide a table of contents at the beginning of the  portfolio. Also be sure to include page numbers. A creative cover page is encouraged, include your name and CPP year on the cover page. When using existing materials from your assignments, be sure to provide clear description of the material. For example, you’ll want provide a quick description/introduction to your college list rather than just a copy and paste of the material without providing any context.

All essays should be single spaced with prompt and word count on top. Please only include the final revision of your essays. Final revision of your resume should be on its own page. Materials copied from the webapp forms should be reformatted to create a consistent look and feel throughout your portfolio. Note: Liem will try to provide prepopulated tables for selected assignments from the webapp such as your college and scholarship list. Lastly, please keep your font to a reasonable size (not too big - 11/12 point works well).

**Attachments** – transcript, common application and other attachments should be inserted into your portfolio.  Instructions to insert PDF file into a Google Document to be provided.

**Placeholders** – for the first draft, you will not have materials necessary to complete all the sections. For these sections, please include placeholders so we know that you intent to include the missing materials in your final version of the portfolio.

**Questions** – Please feel free to ask us lots of questions - on the forums is best.  Your mentor may be able to help with edits and tech issues as well.  This help is encouraged, but make sure that you, the student are doing the work yourself!  

**Deliverable** – A single PDF, uploaded to the webapp, in its polished, professional form.  We estimate portfolios will be approximately 100 pages.  If yours is shorter than 80 pages, please send to us ahead for review and approval.  Think POLISH!!!

A sample outline of the portfolio can be found as a [PDF](/assets/cpp2015_portfolio_template.pdf) or as a [Word Document](/assets/cpp2015_portfolio_template.doc) (you can edit in google drive).
