## Introduction


*“Just keep swimming.”
~ Dory, Finding Nemo*

College Prep consists of various activities designed to get you prepared for your college applications, college life, and your future career.  During the summer, we will have a mix of different activities, designed to keep things interesting and fun.  Many assignments will be completed as part of small teams, which is similar to group work in college and engineering and science projects in the “real-world.”  Be sure not to let your teammates down!

Everyone who you meet in CPP is a volunteer who has given up their Saturday to teach and mentor you.  You and your classmates were selected from a very competitive pool to attend this summer’s program.  Work hard, have fun, and do your best!!!

We think of you as little brothers and sisters and will do everything we can to help you achieve your dreams!

**How to excel in CPP:**

- Don’t miss class
- Do all your assignments on time
- Come to class with a positive attitude ready
- Work hard
- Check email and the webapp daily!
