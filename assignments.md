### Core Assignment #1:  College Essay Outlines  

Outline two candidate essay topics from the Common Application Essay Prompts, being sure to express your main ideas and supporting points. Choose topics that will let you express your accomplishments and your unique voice!
It is not required that you follow this exact format for an outline, because 650 words is relatively short, and you may wish to write in a slightly different format. However, we strongly encourage using this template to capture all of your ideas.

Your outlines should each have the following parts:

- Clearly stated prompt
- Why you chose prompt
- How you think you showcase your standout factor
- Could anyone else write this essay? (remember to be unique!)
- Main idea
- Supporting Point 1 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Supporting Point 2 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Supporting Point 3 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Conclusion

For prompts please see the [Common App Website](http://www.commonapp.org/whats-appening/application-updates/common-application-announces-2016-2017-essay-prompts).     

Our two recommended prompts this year are (you may choose your own if you prefer):
- Describe a problem you’ve solved or a problem you’d like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma-anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.
- Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.

A template that meets this standard is [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_outline.doc).

### Core Assignment 3 Study Skills 1: Learning Assessment

What is your learning style?
Find out your learning style by taking the [VARK Questionnaire](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/the-vark-questionnaire-for-younger-people/). Read about what the results mean. Write a brief (one page) plan on how you plan to incorporate what you have learned into your study habits. Be specific by providing examples.
The document should contain the following:

A. VARK scores for each. Example:
- Visual: 12
- Aural: 7
- Read/Write: 0
- Kinesthetic: 14

B. Plan for incorporating these findings into your individualized study approach as your prepare to take the SAT. How will you study for math? writing? verbal?
Visit [this link](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/the-vark-questionnaire-for-younger-people/) to complete the survey. Do not overthink the questions. Pick what fits YOU best. Also, you can pick more than one if there is not a winner out of the four choices.

#### [](#ca004)

### Core Assignment 4  Self Reflection #1: (Not) Killing Your Dreams

For this week’s self-reflection assignment, you will do the following
1. Read [10 differences between a dream and a goal](https://timemanagementninja.com/2013/04/10-big-differences-between-goals-and-dreams-that-you-must-know/), and write a brief (0.5-1 page, double spaced) essay that discusses the following: what are your personal dreams? This essay will focus on dreams (instead of goals), therefore feel free to express what you are thinking, even if it seems far out of reach or “crazy.” Make sure to include at least one personal (ie. family, friends, etc) and one professional (career, type of work, etc) dream. One way to think about this is to imagine yourself in about 5-10 years and think about what is making you happy and so excited about life!

2. Next, watch the TED talk on: [5 Ways to Kill Your Dreams](https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams?language=en). Then, write a brief essay (0.5-1 page, double spaced) with an example of a time when you acted or thought (or might have acted or thought) in a way that could “kill a dream,” according to the TED speaker. Be specific and share that story in your essay. (For example, you might have believed that overnight success is real and that Bill Gates became a billionaire because he is just so brilliant.) Explore your example and how you feel now after watching this TED talk.
In summary, you will turn in TWO small essays as a single document, each corresponding to the tasks above.

#### [](#ca005)

### Core Assignment #5:  CPP Application Self-Review

To receive credit, you must identify at least 5 strengths and 5 weaknesses and discuss in sentence/paragraph form, and you must use our template. :)
The template is [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_appreview.doc).

#### [](#ca006)

### Core Assignment #6:  (Portfolio) CPP Summary Sheet v0

To receive credit, you should draft a 1-page dashboard following the instructions in the Parent Workshop.  The six categories are:  grades, testing, impact and initiative, essays, polish, and money.  List your current plans and progress for each of the categories and also where you are and where you plan to be in:  October and when you apply for college.  We will go over these in lots of detail next week!  A picture from the board is below.

#### [](#ca007)

### Core Assignment #7:  Study Skills 2 Time Management

Prepare a schedule for this summer  that reflects your activities and responsibilities on the appropriate time slot (as shown on the example that was sent to you previously). The schedule should be parsed in 1-hr intervals, and contain as much specific details as possible. If things change week to week, then remove the detail and leave it more generic. For example, if your volunteering activities change every week, then just label it “Volunteering Activity,” but if it is specific, add the detail “Volunteer at Soup Kitchen.” For the orange portion (college preparation), you MUST to be specific for the type of work you will be doing. It is NOT ok to just write, “SAT Khan Academy” without it saying, “SAT Khan Academy: Math videos” or “SAT Khan Academy Math Problems.” Remember that the allocation of task needs to reflect what YOU need to be working on this summer.
To complete this assignment, you will start with the file that was sent to you containing a sample schedule. Make the adjustments to fit YOUR schedule and responsibilities/activities. You will “print” the schedule as a PDF, making sure that it fits into one readable page (or 2 if needed).  [We will send this in a couple of days…start on the other assignments]

#### [](#ca008)

- What is your overall approach to time managment?
- Is it working?
- Do you do better or worse managing your time and achieving your goals in periods of high stress?
- Do you succeed because of good time management or do you generally manage to succeed despite not managing your time well?
- Give at least one example of a time that you effectively managed your time for a project.
- Give at least one example of a time when you failed to manage your time well and things didn't go so well.
- Have you been able to stick to the time management schedules you've set in the past?  
- Reflect on, and set a specific goal for how to improve your time management skills this summer!

#### [](#ca021)

### Core Assignment 21 -  Portfolio Check 1

This assignment is designed to get you thinking about where you are headed in more detail, and to start thinking about your final portfolio (never too soon!)

A template (required) can be found [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_portfoliocheck1.docx).

- This assignment should all fit on one page please!  Double check the PDF to make sure.  

- The dashboard is the same as what you did last week, but please add more detail (briefly).  Sentences are NOT needed here.  Make sure you score yourself NOW, in OCTOBER (after CPP) and when you apply to college (December of senior year) everywhere there are slashes  (for example 20/100 for essay now, 80/100 for essay quality in October, and 95/100 by application time).  Use whatever scales make sense to you, where 100 or the top possible score is what would be needed to get into your dream school and pay for it.  For plans, you can be very brief but give us a sense of what you're thinking.

- The theme and standout factors are similar to what you've done in the mentoring session and in your assignments.  Feel free to reuse.  This should be in complete sentences and something you can read aloud smoothly.  Bold your one-two word standout factors.

- For why a college should accept you, please list 3-5 reasons, in complete sentences - bullets using complete sentences are fine.  Do your best and we'll chat about it on Saturday

- For your college list, we know you are still working on this.  So please make sure you have at least 8 schools for now, with 2 dream, 2 reach, 2 match, and 2 safety schools.  Put (D)(R)(M)(S) after each school as appropriate.  Make sure they match your dashboard

- For priorities, please list 3-5 for this summer - they don't all have to be CPP related, but think about things that help with your future.

### Core Assignment 22 Questbridge Application Revision 1A

Questbridge is a national program that offers full scholarships (meets all remaining need) for high-achieving, low-income students through a very competitive admissions process.  
Many CPP students are ideal candidates - the required essays are good practice for everyone.

In order to give you the most topics to choose from when filling out applications and scholarships, it is **REQUIRED** that you write a new essay with different examples and ideas than the ones that you already explored in your Common App and other essays!

To receive credit, please:

1.  Make a Questbridge account at www.questbridge.org, and begin filling out an application (nothing to turn in for this)
2.  Answer the following prompt (the first Questbridge essay).  To receive credit, it should be between 700-800 words!  As always, please use the essay template.  *You will turn in this essay using the webapp to receive credit*:

"We are interested in learning more about you and the context in which you have grown up, formed your aspirations, and accomplished your academic successes. Please describe the factors and challenges that have most shaped your personal life and aspirations. How have these factors helped you to grow?"

#### [](#ca023)

### Core Assignment 23 -  Scholarship Activity I

Please write a detailed plan for how you plan to pay for college.  Please talk with your parents and consider past conversations, as well as what you've learned about financial aid packages and school awards so far.  Do you have a reasonable path to getting school paid for?  Or do you still need to make changes to your approach (becoming a more competitive applicant, choosing schools that offer more awards, looking for and applying to scholarhips...)  

Please write us a detailed plan to pay for school, including a self-evaluation and what concrete steps you plan to take to improve.  Minimum 1 full page - but we expect most students will need two pages.  :)

Include a start to a list of scholarships to which you plan to apply.  (The previewing assignment has some starting points.)  We will continue to build on this in future weeks.


#### [](#ca024)

### Core Assignment 24 -  Common App Essay #1 Revision 2

Please revise your essay, based on the detailed feedback you received from the essay/resume review process (required), as well as additional feedback from your mentor (optional).  You must use the template to receive credit.

**General Revision Instructions**

For your next essay revision, be sure to incorporate feedback from your mentor and other volunteers. You can find the feedback by revisiting your previous revision on the webapp. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon next to your previous revision will allow you to view the essay; notice that there are now a few more tabs with individualized feedback just for you. Be sure to review the marked up essay as well as the Essay Review Sheet. Email Liem if you are having trouble with viewing your essay feedback.

After you've read the feedback, you're required to consider incorporating the suggestions from your reviewers into your next revision for an even more polished essay. Typically you'll have at least two reviewers per essay. This is by design so that your essay is reviewed with multiple perspectives. Be sure to address all the suggestions you received from the reviewed essay and review sheet. If you happen to see conflicting suggestions from two different reviewers, use your best judgement and choose the suggestion that makes the most sense to you.  *The essay belongs to you, so you are allowed to discard feedback if it isn't true to you or your voice.  If you disregard lots of suggestions, be sure to let us know why on the essay/resume review sheet so that we know you considered everything and chose a different direction.*

Remember, your next revision must be significantly different (and better) than the prior one. Before you turn in the essay, briefly compare the two revisions, if they are very similar, you have not make enough improvements! Don't forget to keep track of your major changes at the end of your essay as required by the template.  

If you decide you don't like your topic at all, that's ok!  But please check with us, first, so we can help guide you.  If you did not complete your earlier draft on time, please check with us about how to proceed.


#### [](#ca025)

### Core Assignment 25 - Activities and Honors List

The activities and award resume assignment is an important part of your application and is a way to showcase what you have accomplished over the past few years.  The first draft of the assignment asks you to brainstorm and list everything that you can possibly remember.

Generally, you should only focus on activities beginning in 9th grade, although if you started an activity earlier, you may list it if it is especially impressive, or if you have been doing the activity for many years (for example:  Basketball, 4th grade – present).  Generally schools will give much more weight to your high school information.  

In activities, remember to include everything, including jobs, volunteering, church activities, sports, clubs, service trips, and other things you do for fun.  Remember that things like student government, being in a band/music group, JROTC, cheerleading, etc. all count!

Prioritize things that you have spent the most time in, and that show leadership.  You can include planned activities for future years, too!


#### [](#ca026)

### Core Assignment 26 -  Study Skills 3:  Big and Small Rocks

*What are your big and small rocks?*  How does Nate’s presentation and discussion relate to your weekly goals and priorities?  For this study skills assignment, you will

1. *Create a list* of 20 (minimum)  “rocks” that includes big ones and small ones.  Remember that the big “rocks” are things that you MUST accomplish every week to fulfill your dreams and goals, and to stay alive and healthy (ie. Eating, sleeping, attending CPP/school).  Smaller “rocks” include things that you sort of have to get done but are optional or not essential.  You can choose to have a category for medium-sized rocks, if you’d like.

Format for the list:

Big rocks

- Rock 1 description (2-4 words)
- Rock 2 description (2-4 words)
- Etc…

Small Rocks

- Rock 1 description (2-4 words)
- Rock 2 description (2-4 words)
- Etc…


2. *Discuss* (1 page minimum, double spaced) how you are incorporating these “rocks” into your weekly schedule, and if the allocated portion of time/energy devoted to them matches their priority level.  For example, if SAT is a big rock and Netflix a small rock, are you allocating more time to SAT prep to ensure that you have “the big rocks in first?” How are you doing this?  Perhaps for you it is not just how much time you put into the task but also when (early vs. late) you finish that task on a given day.

#### [](#ca027)

### Core Assignment 27 -  Study Skills 4:  Previewing

**Study Skills #4:  Previewing**

*Due in class on Saturday!*

Every week we will send you general topics that we will be covering on the upcoming Saturday and you will be expected to spend a couple of hours per week preparing for class.   

For this week's study skills assignment, you will show us how well you are previewing as part of your study process.  Because we need to assess your success in this activity (to better help you and for you to better help yourself), this week's assignment will take approximately 3-4 hours.  

Topic for this Saturday: Financial Aid!! ($$$)
More specifically, we will be discussing: the Federal Financial Aid programs, Questbridge Scholarship, other national scholarship programs, school scholarships such as UMBC Honors Scholars, and other financial aid programs through the federal government.  Relevant resources for this class:

#### General information

- https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/

- http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/
- http://www.finaid.org/loans/
- http://www.finaid.org/questions/noloansforlowincome.phtml
- http://www.fastweb.com/college-scholarships
- http://scholarships.fastweb.com/y-high-school-seniors

#### Specific Scholarships (sampling)

- http://www.questbridge.org
- https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/ugsp
- http://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/
- http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/college-scholarship/
- http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/programs/the-siemens-competition-in-math-science-technology/
- https://scholarships.uncf.org/
- https://www.hsf.net/

**You do NOT need to turn in anything.  The way we will know how well you prepared is:**

1. What insightful questions you ask during class. (Asking, "what is questbridge?" is not insightful, that is available in the resources!  But asking, "what if my most successful course was in English and I'm applying for Gates.  Can I say that for one of their essays?" IS an insightful question.  It shows that you read the information but did not understand that part).  Please post questions to the forum if you're wondering about this requirement!

2. How well you answer questions from the facilitator during class discussion or during the parent-student workshop.  You must answer at least one question correctly

You have to do both of the above to get a point for the assignment.

BOTTOM LINE:  if you read through the materials listed above, browse enough to get a good foundation of knowledge (even enough to mention a few facts about each and teach a friend about it), write down questions that you have as you prepare, and actively listen in class, you will have NO problem getting a point.  Trust me.  We are not going to give you a PhD exam on this, ok?  Pretend you are reading to be able to teach your family and friends.

#### [](#ca028)

### Core Assignment 28 -  Resume Revision 1

or the first version, please complete a draft of your resume.  Here are some resources to help:

- A template for building your resume (strongly recommended) is available [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_resume.doc).
- Our reviewers will use the following checklist to review your resume.  Please revise your resume to satisfy all of these requirements before submitting! [CPP Resume Review Sheet](/cppbook/assets/cpp_resume_checklist.pdf) - resumes not meeting these criteria or exceeding one page (even a second blank page!) will not receive credit.  Make sure to use lots of detail and emphasize your strengths.

- An example resume can be found [here](/cppbook/assets/simpson_resume_example.pdf).

You may wish to do the Resume Ninja Assignment first - it usually helps to see what good looks like and clarifies your thoughts!

Recommendation:  Work with your mentor to create and revise your resume draft.  Focus on brainstorming about different activities, experience, and accomplishments that you can add to your resume.


#### [](#ca029)

### Core Assignment 29 -  FAFSA FSAID and Forecaster

In order to apply for federal financial aid, you and at least one of your parent/guardians need to get a FSAID.  It can often take several days (occasionally longer) for verification, and so we want you to begin this process, now.  The assignment is graded on the Honor Code.  Simply write, on the digital template, “I got an FSAID" and “My parent/guardian got an FSAID" once you both have completed the process.

You and your parents should get a FSAID from [here](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/fsaid), then visit the FAFSA Forecaster website [here](https://fafsa.ed.gov/FAFSA/app/f4cForm?locale=en_EN)

Please complete this assignment by using the online form, and make very sure that you write down the EFC number.  Lots of students choose the wrong number on the page, because it's a bit confusing!  You *must also* send Will your summary page (the one with the EFC) to complete this assignment.

It's really important to get this done on time, because it will help us strategize with you on a payment strategy for school!

If you are not eligible for an FSAID, instead of completing this assignment, please write a (1-page minimum) essay explaining *specifics* of your strategy to pay for college, specifically how it relates to how you plan to overcome this barrier (different than Scholarship Activity I).  A starting point is [here](http://www.maldef.org/leadership/scholarships/index.html).  Please also include any questions you have for us and email directly to Will by the deadline.

(The FSA ID replaced the Federal Student Aid PIN on May 10, 2015. If you haven’t logged in to a Federal Student Aid site (such as fafsa.gov or StudentLoans.gov) since then, you will need to create an FSA ID before you can log on in the future. If you already have a PIN, you can link your information to your new FSA ID by entering your PIN while registering for your FSA ID. This will save you time when registering for your FSA ID.) If you’ve forgotten your PIN, don’t worry; you can either enter the answer to your PIN “challenge question” during the FSA ID registration process to link your PIN, or you can just create your FSA ID from scratch.)

### Core Assignment 31 - Self Reflection 3

For this week’s self-reflection, you will take a break from writing yet another essay and instead you will DRAW!  

Take out your old set of crayons, markers, and/or color pencils and get ready to demonstrate what you’re thinking about and feeling through this art modality.

### Core Assignment 55 - Self Reflection 6 Looking for a Major- A Scavenger Hunt!

Congratulations! For today’s self-reflection you have been accepted early decision to Vanderbilt University, with almost a full-ride, and you are expected to begin classes this fall (August 22nd).  Before you can enroll in your classes, Vanderbilt is requesting that you pick a major from one of their undergraduate programs.  This whole time you have been “undecided” because you couldn’t decide between two majors, and now it is time to make that choice!  Uh oh...it’s stressful...so you develop the following plan and execute it carefully:

- You will visit Vanderbilt’s website and look for the school catalogs (link: http://www.vanderbilt.edu/catalogs/index.html).  Choose “Undergraduate Catalogs” since you will be pursuing your undergraduate degree.

- You will choose **two** majors that you are interested in.  For purposes of this exercise, you are required to only choose ONE major from a single school at Vanderbilt, the second major must come from a different school at Vanderbilt.  Remember that Vanderbilt is a university (versus a “college”) and therefore it has multiple “schools” or “colleges.”  Some of them include: College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, and the School of Engineering. We recommend that you pick your **own** first choice major and let your second choice be either your real second choice, or another fun major to explore.  **Pro-tip:** did you know that you can major in Computer Science from the College of Arts & Science OR from the School of Engineering? Wondering what the difference is? You can choose Computer Science from each and explore! :)

- To find out what majors are offered, read through the pages in the undergraduate catalog that lists the major available for each of the schools within Vanderbilt. Here’s how:  from the undergraduate catalog page, click on a particular school.  There should now be a link to “degree programs” which then takes you to the page in the catalog where the majors are listed. College of Arts and Science has this info starting on page 80.

- Scan through these pages to find the major you’re interested in and then scroll down within the catalog to find where the details for the program of study are discussed.  You don’t have to read every word, but the goals are for you to get a **general idea of how the catalog is organized, what information is contained, where you would find information about requirements for the major of your choice, and what other interesting pieces of information are contained in the catalog**.  Pro-tip: did you know that there are scholarship and honors program descriptions listed here as well?

- Go to the page listing your major requirements and see the required courses that you will be taking.

- Go and look at the description of these courses.  What do you think? Are they interesting to you? Do they seem cool? Pro-tip (optional): if you want to learn more, try doing a search at the main school website.  You might be able to find the class website!

- Repeat this process for your second major but at a different school within Vanderbilt University.

You will then prepare a 2-page (minimum, 1 page per major, double-spaced) discussing the following:

- Which major did you choose and from which school? (e.g., Page 1: “I chose to major in Electrical Engineering at the School of Engineering;” Page 2: “I chose to major in Neuroscience at the College of Arts and Science.”)

- Are there any general education requirements?  These are requirements that are required from ALL students in that school/college, regardless of their specific major.  For example, as an engineering student all freshmen and sophomores are required to take: Calculus 1 and 2, General Chemistry, etc.  What are YOUR general education requirements? Are these taken during your freshman year only or throughout other years? Be specific!

- Pick two of your favorite general education courses and discuss what you will be learning in them (according to the catalog!).
What courses are required for your major?  List the abbreviated titles and/or list the requirement.  

- Pick two of your favorite major courses and discuss what you will be learning in them (according to the catalog!).

- Overall, discuss what you thought about pursuing this major...does it sound like things you are interested in learning more about?  Were you excited as you read through the program requirements?  What does this mean in terms of choosing a major?

While getting ready to set off in pursuit of your dreams, it's important to get to know yourself.  One important aspect of getting to know yourself is to understand your own background.  And where's a good place to start?  Right at home – with, of course, your parents or guardians!

Please ask your interviewee to set aside 30 minutes - 1 hour  to meet with you and tell you about him/herself.  Here are a few pointers of questions to ask...but feel free to substitute for your own or add any that you'd like:

- Where were you born?  How long did you live there?  Do you remember those times?  Was it a big town or little town?
- Where were your parents born? What did they tell you about their childhood?
- What were the main (most important) things that your parents taught you? Were they strict about you going to school?  Did they encourage you to study?  Did they encourage you to get a job?
- How would you consider your relationship with your parents when you were my age?  Did you talk to them a lot about your personal thoughts and issues?  Did you have to behave a certain way in order to "be a good daughter/son"?  Can you describe that?
- When you were my age, how did you picture yourself in 20 years? (Meaning, when you were ~16 years old, how did you picture yourself as a 35 year old?)  What kind of dreams and aspirations did you have when you were my age? What were the things you hoped to do when you 'grew up"?
- For the most part, do you feel like you've accomplished what you wanted to do?
- As your son/daughter, what is the most important teaching you hope I carry with me as I embark on my own journey someday?
- Do you have any career aspirations and dreams for me?  Do you have any personal dreams/aspirations for me?
- Why do you want me to go to college?
- Would you support me and encourage me to go to graduate school or professional school (medicine, law, etc)?
- What would you like me to get out of my college experience?  What is the most important thing to you regarding my attendance to college?

Make sure you take notes during the interview...or even better yet, if you have access to a voice recorder or video camera, this might be a good time to use it.  With all of this information, please write an essay that introduces us to your parents (include their names) and shares with us the topics listed above.  Basically, who are your parents, what is their background, what values did they learn as children/young adults, what they hope for your future, and finally, what did you learn about yourself and your goals from getting to know your parents' background.

### Core Assignment 78 - Recommender List

One really important part of your applications is your recommendation letters.  Although there are exceptions, here are some basic rules:

- Choose teachers that know you well.
- Ask each recommender if they “have time to write you a strong recommendation.”  This gives them an opportunity to say no, and helps to make sure that all of your recommendations are really good.
- Typically you will want to choose at least 2 academic teachers that you had in class in 10th or 11th grade.  (Check college requirements.)  Someone who taught you science, math, or engineering would be a good choice for at least one letter.
- You will also want to identify club and community organization leaders who know you outside of school and can speak to your accomplishments.  These letters should not replace your core academic letters.
- Often schools will also want to have a letter from your guidance counselor.
- Make it easy on your recommenders.  Be professional!  Bring your resume, all of the materials your teacher needs for each school (form+stamped envelope or website URL or…), and the due date.  Ask AT LEAST 6 weeks ahead, 8 weeks is better.  4 weeks is an absolute minimum (for a teacher you haven’t asked before) – once you’ve gotten one letter from a teacher, 4 weeks ahead is a good timeframe.

To complete this assignment, please list 6 potential recommenders, and give a short (2 sentence) explanation of how you know them and why you chose that person.  You should feel confident that each teacher knows you well and that they will write you a good letter!  At least 3 of these recommenders should be academic teachers.  Additionally, one should be a guidance/career counselor.  You may need him/her to fill out forms, and you can have them write one of your letters if you know them well.  You should not list family members.
