### Core Assignment #1:  College Essay Outlines  

Outline two candidate essay topics from the Common Application Essay Prompts, being sure to express your main ideas and supporting points. Choose topics that will let you express your accomplishments and your unique voice!
It is not required that you follow this exact format for an outline, because 650 words is relatively short, and you may wish to write in a slightly different format. However, we strongly encourage using this template to capture all of your ideas.

Your outlines should each have the following parts:

- Clearly stated prompt
- Why you chose prompt
- How you think you showcase your standout factor
- Could anyone else write this essay? (remember to be unique!)
- Main idea
- Supporting Point 1 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Supporting Point 2 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Supporting Point 3 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Conclusion

For prompts please see the [Common App Website](http://www.commonapp.org/whats-appening/application-updates/common-application-announces-2016-2017-essay-prompts).     

Our two recommended prompts this year are (you may choose your own if you prefer):
- Describe a problem you’ve solved or a problem you’d like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma-anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.
- Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.

A template that meets this standard is [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_outline.doc).

### Core Assignment 3 Study Skills 1: Learning Assessment

Find out your learning style by taking the [VARK Questionnaire](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/the-vark-questionnaire-for-younger-people/). Read about what the results mean. Write a brief (one page) plan on how you plan to incorporate what you have learned into your study habits. Be specific by providing examples.

#### [](#ca004)

### Core Assignment 4  Self Reflection #1: (Not) Killing Your Dreams

For this week’s self-reflection assignment, you will do the following
1. Read [10 differences between a dream and a goal](https://timemanagementninja.com/2013/04/10-big-differences-between-goals-and-dreams-that-you-must-know/), and write a brief (0.5-1 page, double spaced) essay that discusses the following: what are your personal dreams? This essay will focus on dreams (instead of goals), therefore feel free to express what you are thinking, even if it seems far out of reach or “crazy.” Make sure to include at least one personal (ie. family, friends, etc) and one professional (career, type of work, etc) dream. One way to think about this is to imagine yourself in about 5-10 years and think about what is making you happy and so excited about life!

2. Next, watch the TED talk on: [5 Ways to Kill Your Dreams](https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams?language=en). Then, write a brief essay (0.5-1 page, double spaced) with an example of a time when you acted or thought (or might have acted or thought) in a way that could “kill a dream,” according to the TED speaker. Be specific and share that story in your essay. (For example, you might have believed that overnight success is real and that Bill Gates became a billionaire because he is just so brilliant.) Explore your example and how you feel now after watching this TED talk.
In summary, you will turn in TWO small essays as a single document, each corresponding to the tasks above.

#### [](#ca005)

### Core Assignment #5:  CPP Application Self-Review

To receive credit, you must identify at least 5 strengths and 5 weaknesses and discuss in sentence/paragraph form, and you must use our template. :)
The template is [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_appreview.doc).

#### [](#ca006)

### Core Assignment #6:  (Portfolio) CPP Summary Sheet v0

To receive credit, you should draft a 1-page dashboard following the instructions in the Parent Workshop.  The six categories are:  grades, testing, impact and initiative, essays, polish, and money.  List your current plans and progress for each of the categories and also where you are and where you plan to be in:  October and when you apply for college.  We will go over these in lots of detail next week!  A picture from the board is below.

#### [](#ca007)

### Core Assignment #7:  Study Skills 2 Time Management

Prepare a schedule for this summer  that reflects your activities and responsibilities on the appropriate time slot (as shown on the example that was sent to you previously). The schedule should be parsed in 1-hr intervals, and contain as much specific details as possible. If things change week to week, then remove the detail and leave it more generic. For example, if your volunteering activities change every week, then just label it “Volunteering Activity,” but if it is specific, add the detail “Volunteer at Soup Kitchen.” For the orange portion (college preparation), you MUST to be specific for the type of work you will be doing. It is NOT ok to just write, “SAT Khan Academy” without it saying, “SAT Khan Academy: Math videos” or “SAT Khan Academy Math Problems.” Remember that the allocation of task needs to reflect what YOU need to be working on this summer.
To complete this assignment, you will start with the file that was sent to you containing a sample schedule. Make the adjustments to fit YOUR schedule and responsibilities/activities. You will “print” the schedule as a PDF, making sure that it fits into one readable page (or 2 if needed).  [We will send this in a couple of days…start on the other assignments]

#### [](#ca008)

For this assignment, you will write one short essay, approximately 1 page in total.  You should answer the following questions (in complete sentences, about a paragraph per bullet):

- What is your overall approach to time managment?
- Is it working?
- Do you do better or worse managing your time and achieving your goals in periods of high stress?
- Do you succeed because of good time management or do you generally manage to succeed despite not managing your time well?
- Give at least one example of a time that you effectively managed your time for a project.
- Give at least one example of a time when you failed to manage your time well and things didn't go so well.
- Have you been able to stick to the time management schedules you've set in the past?

### Core Assignment 21 -  Porfolio Check 1

This assignment is designed to get you thinking about where you are headed in more detail, and to start thinking about your final portfolio (never too soon!)

A template (required) can be found [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_portfoliocheck1.docx).

- This assignment should all fit on one page please!  Double check the PDF to make sure.  

- The dashboard is the same as what you did last week, but please add more detail (briefly).  Sentences are NOT needed here.  Make sure you score yourself NOW, in OCTOBER (after CPP) and when you apply to college (December of senior year) everywhere there are slashes  (for example 20/100 for essay now, 80/100 for essay quality in October, and 95/100 by application time).  Use whatever scales make sense to you, where 100 or the top possible score is what would be needed to get into your dream school and pay for it.  For plans, you can be very brief but give us a sense of what you're thinking.

- The theme and standout factors are similar to what you've done in the mentoring session and in your assignments.  Feel free to reuse.  This should be in complete sentences and something you can read aloud smoothly.  Bold your one-two word standout factors.

- For why a college should accept you, please list 3-5 reasons, in complete sentences - bullets using complete sentences are fine.  Do your best and we'll chat about it on Saturday

- For your college list, we know you are still working on this.  So please make sure you have at least 8 schools for now, with 2 dream, 2 reach, 2 match, and 2 safety schools.  Put (D)(R)(M)(S) after each school as appropriate.  Make sure they match your dashboard

- For priorities, please list 3-5 for this summer - they don't all have to be CPP related, but think about things that help with your future.

### Core Assignment 22 Questbridge Application Revision 1A

Questbridge is a national program that offers full scholarships (meets all remaining need) for high-achieving, low-income students through a very competitive admissions process.  
Many CPP students are ideal candidates - the required essays are good practice for everyone.

In order to give you the most topics to choose from when filling out applications and scholarships, it is **REQUIRED** that you write a new essay with different examples and ideas than the ones that you already explored in your Common App and other essays!

To receive credit, please:

1.  Make a Questbridge account at www.questbridge.org, and begin filling out an application (nothing to turn in for this)
2.  Answer the following prompt (the first Questbridge essay).  To receive credit, it should be between 700-800 words!  As always, please use the essay template.  *You will turn in this essay using the webapp to receive credit*:

"We are interested in learning more about you and the context in which you have grown up, formed your aspirations, and accomplished your academic successes. Please describe the factors and challenges that have most shaped your personal life and aspirations. How have these factors helped you to grow?"

### Core Assignment 23 -  Scholarship Activity I

Please write a detailed plan for how you plan to pay for college.  Please talk with your parents and consider past conversations, as well as what you've learned about financial aid packages and school awards so far.  Do you have a reasonable path to getting school paid for?  Or do you still need to make changes to your approach (becoming a more competitive applicant, choosing schools that offer more awards, looking for and applying to scholarhips...)  

Please write us a detailed plan to pay for school, including a self-evaluation and what concrete steps you plan to take to improve.  Minimum 1 full page - but we expect most students will need two pages.  :)

Include a start to a list of scholarships to which you plan to apply.  (The previewing assignment has some starting points.)  We will continue to build on this in future weeks.


#### [](#ca024)

### Core Assignment 24 -  Common App Essay #1 Revision 2

Please revise your essay, based on the detailed feedback you received from the essay/resume review process (required), as well as additional feedback from your mentor (optional).

**General Revision Instructions**

For your next essay revision, be sure to incorporate feedback from your mentor and other volunteers. You can find the feedback by revisiting your previous revision on the webapp. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon next to your previous revision will allow you to view the essay; notice that there are now a few more tabs with individualized feedback just for you. Be sure to review the marked up essay as well as the Essay Review Sheet. Email Liem if you are having trouble with viewing your essay feedback.

After you've read the feedback, you're required to consider incorporating the suggestions from your reviewers into your next revision for an even more polished essay. Typically you'll have at least two reviewers per essay. This is by design so that your essay is reviewed with multiple perspectives. Be sure to address all the suggestions you received from the reviewed essay and review sheet. If you happen to see conflicting suggestions from two different reviewers, use your best judgement and choose the suggestion that makes the most sense to you.  *The essay belongs to you, so you are allowed to discard feedback if it isn't true to you or your voice.  If you disregard lots of suggestions, be sure to let us know why on the essay/resume review sheet so that we know you considered everything and chose a different direction.*

Remember, your next revision must be significantly different (and better) than the prior one. Before you turn in the essay, briefly compare the two revisions, if they are very similar, you have not make enough improvements! Don't forget to keep track of your major changes at the end of your essay as required by the template.  

If you decide you don't like your topic at all, that's ok!  But please check with us, first, so we can help guide you.  If you did not complete your earlier draft on time, please check with us about how to proceed.


#### [](#ca025)

### Core Assignment 25 - Activities and Honors List

The activities and award resume assignment is an important part of your application and is a way to showcase what you have accomplished over the past few years.  The first draft of the assignment asks you to brainstorm and list everything that you can possibly remember.

Generally, you should only focus on activities beginning in 9th grade, although if you started an activity earlier, you may list it if it is especially impressive, or if you have been doing the activity for many years (for example:  Basketball, 4th grade – present).  Generally schools will give much more weight to your high school information.  

In activities, remember to include everything, including jobs, volunteering, church activities, sports, clubs, service trips, and other things you do for fun.  Remember that things like student government, being in a band/music group, JROTC, cheerleading, etc. all count!

Prioritize things that you have spent the most time in, and that show leadership.  You can include planned activities for future years, too!

### Core Assignment 26 -  Study Skills 3:  Big and Small Rocks

#### [](#ca027)

### Core Assignment 27 -  Study Skills 4:  Previewing

**Study Skills #4:  Previewing**

*Due in class on Saturday!*

Every week we will send you general topics that we will be covering on the upcoming Saturday and you will be expected to spend a couple of hours per week preparing for class.   

For this week's study skills assignment, you will show us how well you are previewing as part of your study process.  Because we need to assess your success in this activity (to better help you and for you to better help yourself), this week's assignment will take approximately 3-4 hours.  

Topic for this Saturday: Financial Aid!! ($$$)
More specifically, we will be discussing: the Federal Financial Aid programs, Questbridge Scholarship, other national scholarship programs, school scholarships such as UMBC Honors Scholars, and other financial aid programs through the federal government.  Relevant resources for this class:

#### General information

- http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/programs/the-siemens-competition-in-math-science-technology/
- https://scholarships.uncf.org/
- https://www.hsf.net/

**You do NOT need to turn in anything.  The way we will know how well you prepared is:**

1. What insightful questions you ask during class. (Asking, "what is questbridge?" is not insightful, that is available in the resources!  But asking, "what if my most successful course was in English and I'm applying for Gates.  Can I say that for one of their essays?" IS an insightful question.  It shows that you read the information but did not understand that part).  Please post questions to the forum if you're wondering about this requirement!

2. How well you answer questions from the facilitator during class discussion or during the parent-student workshop.  You must answer at least one question correctly

You have to do both of the above to get a point for the assignment.

BOTTOM LINE:  if you read through the materials listed above, browse enough to get a good foundation of knowledge (even enough to mention a few facts about each and teach a friend about it), write down questions that you have as you prepare, and actively listen in class, you will have NO problem getting a point.  Trust me.  We are not going to give you a PhD exam on this, ok?  Pretend you are reading to be able to teach your family and friends.

#### [](#ca028)

### Core Assignment 28 -  Resume Revision 1

or the first version, please complete a draft of your resume.  Here are some resources to help:

- A template for building your resume (strongly recommended) is available [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_resume.doc).
- Our reviewers will use the following checklist to review your resume.  Please revise your resume to satisfy all of these requirements before submitting! [CPP Resume Review Sheet](/cppbook/assets/cpp_resume_checklist.pdf) - resumes not meeting these criteria or exceeding one page (even a second blank page!) will not receive credit.  Make sure to use lots of detail and emphasize your strengths.

- An example resume can be found [here](/cppbook/assets/simpson_resume_example.pdf).

You may wish to do the Resume Ninja Assignment first - it usually helps to see what good looks like and clarifies your thoughts!

Recommendation:  Work with your mentor to create and revise your resume draft.  Focus on brainstorming about different activities, experience, and accomplishments that you can add to your resume.


#### [](#ca029)

### Core Assignment 29 -  FAFSA FSAID and Forecaster

In order to apply for federal financial aid, you and at least one of your parent/guardians need to get a FSAID.  It can often take several days (occasionally longer) for verification, and so we want you to begin this process, now.  The assignment is graded on the Honor Code.  Simply write, on the digital template, “I got an FSAID" and “My parent/guardian got an FSAID" once you both have completed the process.

You and your parents should get a FSAID from [here](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/fsaid), then visit the FAFSA Forecaster website [here](https://fafsa.ed.gov/FAFSA/app/f4cForm?locale=en_EN)

Please complete this assignment by using the online form, and make very sure that you write down the EFC number.  Lots of students choose the wrong number on the page, because it's a bit confusing!  You *must also* send Will your summary page (the one with the EFC) to complete this assignment.

It's really important to get this done on time, because it will help us strategize with you on a payment strategy for school!

If you are not eligible for an FSAID, instead of completing this assignment, please write a (1-page minimum) essay explaining *specifics* of your strategy to pay for college, specifically how it relates to how you plan to overcome this barrier (different than Scholarship Activity I).  A starting point is [here](http://www.maldef.org/leadership/scholarships/index.html).  Please also include any questions you have for us and email directly to Will by the deadline.

(The FSA ID replaced the Federal Student Aid PIN on May 10, 2015. If you haven’t logged in to a Federal Student Aid site (such as fafsa.gov or StudentLoans.gov) since then, you will need to create an FSA ID before you can log on in the future. If you already have a PIN, you can link your information to your new FSA ID by entering your PIN while registering for your FSA ID. This will save you time when registering for your FSA ID.) If you’ve forgotten your PIN, don’t worry; you can either enter the answer to your PIN “challenge question” during the FSA ID registration process to link your PIN, or you can just create your FSA ID from scratch.)

Your drawing can be just with pencil, if you prefer no color.  You can borrow supplies from little siblings or cousins or friends, if you’d like. Be creative and have fun with this assignment!

You will turn in a one-page drawing the answers the following question:

What does your life look like when you are Will & Karla’s age?  This should be about 15 years for most of you (we will leave it at that! haha).  What experiences will be in your memories?  What skills will be part of your toolbox? What will you be looking forward to?  How will you be feeling?

#### [](#ca032)

### Core Assignment 32 - Porfolio Check 2

You can find the feedback by revisiting your previous revision on the webapp. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon next to your previous revision will allow you to view the essay; notice that there are now a few more tabs with individualized feedback just for you. Be sure to review the marked up essay as well as the Essay Review Sheet. Email Liem if you are having trouble with viewing your essay feedback.

After you've read the feedback, you're required to consider incorporating the suggestions from your reviewers into your next revision for an even more polished essay. Typically you'll have at least two reviewers per essay. This is by design so that your essay is reviewed with multiple perspectives. Be sure to address all the suggestions you received from the reviewed essay and review sheet. If you happen to see conflicting suggestions from two different reviewers, use your best judgement and choose the suggestion that makes the most sense to you.  *The essay belongs to you, so you are allowed to discard feedback if it isn't true to you or your voice.  If you disregard lots of suggestions, be sure to let us know why on the essay/resume review sheet so that we know you considered everything and chose a different direction.*

Remember, your next revision must be significantly different (and better) than the prior one. Before you turn in the essay, briefly compare the two revisions, if they are very similar, you have not make enough improvements! Don't forget to keep track of your major changes at the end of your essay as required by the template.  

If you decide you don't like your topic at all, that's ok!  But please check with us, first, so we can help guide you.  If you did not complete your earlier draft on time, please check with us about how to proceed.

### Core Assignment 43 - Net Price Calculator

Get Net Price estimates for at least 3 of your top choice schools – including one state school and one private school.  The link to the calculator can be found on each school’s website or by searching for the school on College Navigator (http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/).

Due to a recent Federal Law, all schools must provide a net price calculator on their website.  This will allow you to input information about your family’s financial circumstances and get an accurate estimate of how much you would be expected to pay if admitted.  It generally doesn’t include merit scholarships – only the need based aid part.

You can find these calculators several different ways:

1.  Google search  “Net price calculator Princeton”

2.  Visit a school’s undergraduate office of financial aid

3.  Go to College Navigator (http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/), and look up your school – the website provides a link to each school’s calculator.

### Core Assignment 44 - Self Reflection 4

For this week’s self-reflection, you will continue to explore more about yourself!  First, you will take a personality test called [Myers-Briggs](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp). Once you get your 4-letter code result, you will read the “type description,” which explains what the results mean about yourself.  (Even if you have taken this quiz before, and you already know your 4-letter code, please take it again.  The codes change over time!).  Finally, you will watch a [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts?language=en#t-1124916) on The Power of Introverts.

You will then submit a 1-page (minimum, double spaced) containing the following:

- Your 4-letter code
- Discussion on what you learned about yourself and others from the materials that you read/watched.  Was it a surprise? How do you think you could use this information as you prepare to package yourself for college or as you return to school?
- How can this information help you become a better leader in your community?

For this week’s self-reflection you will share your thoughts about the College Prep Program! We are half-way through the program and we have LOVED getting to know you and your dreams. Your CPP family of leads, coaches, and mentors are here to help and give you a great summer experience. But we want to know what YOU think so that we can best shape the rest of the program.

Please write a 1.5-page (minimum, you are welcome to write more) answering the following questions:

- How much do you feel like you have learned since our first college prep class? Give us some examples.
- Which portions of the program do you like best? Feel free to discuss what you like best and also what is helping you the most. (Sometimes we don’t like things that are really helpful...so feel free to explain!)
- How do you feel college prep could help you even more? Feel free to discuss questions that you STILL have about college (or beyond), careers, dreams, etc. We may have covered a few things that are still not clear to you (or maybe we haven’t gotten to something you were hoping that we would), so feel free to let us know.
- Are you having fun? In class or with coaches and mentors, or through other activities? Let us know how we could make the program more fun.
- How is your interaction with your SAT coach and mentor? Please share and let us know what you like or if there is anything that would make this part of the program better for you.
- Is there anything else you’d like to share with us? Please do! If there is anything that would make the process better for you, we want to know!
