### Core Assignment #1:  College Essay Outlines  

Outline two candidate essay topics from the Common Application Essay Prompts, being sure to express your main ideas and supporting points. Choose topics that will let you express your accomplishments and your unique voice!
It is not required that you follow this exact format for an outline, because 650 words is relatively short, and you may wish to write in a slightly different format. However, we strongly encourage using this template to capture all of your ideas.

Your outlines should each have the following parts:

- Clearly stated prompt
- Why you chose prompt
- How you think you showcase your standout factor
- Could anyone else write this essay? (remember to be unique!)
- Main idea
- Supporting Point 1 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Supporting Point 2 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Supporting Point 3 (+ Related ideas, stories, examples)
- Conclusion

For prompts please see the [Common App Website](http://www.commonapp.org/whats-appening/application-updates/common-application-announces-2016-2017-essay-prompts).     

Our two recommended prompts this year are (you may choose your own if you prefer):
- Describe a problem you’ve solved or a problem you’d like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma-anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.
- Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.

A template that meets this standard is [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_outline.doc).

### Core Assignment 3 Study Skills 1: Learning Assessment

What is your learning style?
Find out your learning style by taking the [VARK Questionnaire](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/the-vark-questionnaire-for-younger-people/). Read about what the results mean. Write a brief (one page) plan on how you plan to incorporate what you have learned into your study habits. Be specific by providing examples.
The document should contain the following:

A. VARK scores for each. Example:
- Visual: 12
- Aural: 7
- Read/Write: 0
- Kinesthetic: 14

B. Plan for incorporating these findings into your individualized study approach as your prepare to take the SAT. How will you study for math? writing? verbal?
Visit [this link](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/the-vark-questionnaire-for-younger-people/) to complete the survey. Do not overthink the questions. Pick what fits YOU best. Also, you can pick more than one if there is not a winner out of the four choices.

### Core Assignment 4  Self Reflection #1: (Not) Killing Your Dreams

For this week’s self-reflection assignment, you will do the following
1. Read [10 differences between a dream and a goal](https://timemanagementninja.com/2013/04/10-big-differences-between-goals-and-dreams-that-you-must-know/), and write a brief (0.5-1 page, double spaced) essay that discusses the following: what are your personal dreams? This essay will focus on dreams (instead of goals), therefore feel free to express what you are thinking, even if it seems far out of reach or “crazy.” Make sure to include at least one personal (ie. family, friends, etc) and one professional (career, type of work, etc) dream. One way to think about this is to imagine yourself in about 5-10 years and think about what is making you happy and so excited about life!

2. Next, watch the TED talk on: [5 Ways to Kill Your Dreams](https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams?language=en). Then, write a brief essay (0.5-1 page, double spaced) with an example of a time when you acted or thought (or might have acted or thought) in a way that could “kill a dream,” according to the TED speaker. Be specific and share that story in your essay. (For example, you might have believed that overnight success is real and that Bill Gates became a billionaire because he is just so brilliant.) Explore your example and how you feel now after watching this TED talk.
In summary, you will turn in TWO small essays as a single document, each corresponding to the tasks above.

### Core Assignment #5:  CPP Application Self-Review

To receive credit, you must identify at least 5 strengths and 5 weaknesses and discuss in sentence/paragraph form, and you must use our template. :)
The template is [here](/cppbook/assets/cpp_template_appreview.doc).

#### [](#ca006)

### Core Assignment #6:  (Portfolio) CPP Summary Sheet v0

To receive credit, you should draft a 1-page dashboard following the instructions in the Parent Workshop.  The six categories are:  grades, testing, impact and initiative, essays, polish, and money.  List your current plans and progress for each of the categories and also where you are and where you plan to be in:  October and when you apply for college.  We will go over these in lots of detail next week!  A picture from the board is below.

#### [](#ca007)

### Core Assignment #7:  Study Skills 2 Time Management

Prepare a schedule for this summer  that reflects your activities and responsibilities on the appropriate time slot (as shown on the example that was sent to you previously). The schedule should be parsed in 1-hr intervals, and contain as much specific details as possible. If things change week to week, then remove the detail and leave it more generic. For example, if your volunteering activities change every week, then just label it “Volunteering Activity,” but if it is specific, add the detail “Volunteer at Soup Kitchen.” For the orange portion (college preparation), you MUST to be specific for the type of work you will be doing. It is NOT ok to just write, “SAT Khan Academy” without it saying, “SAT Khan Academy: Math videos” or “SAT Khan Academy Math Problems.” Remember that the allocation of task needs to reflect what YOU need to be working on this summer.
To complete this assignment, you will start with the file that was sent to you containing a sample schedule. Make the adjustments to fit YOUR schedule and responsibilities/activities. You will “print” the schedule as a PDF, making sure that it fits into one readable page (or 2 if needed).  [We will send this in a couple of days…start on the other assignments]

#### [](#ca008)

### Core Assignment #8:  Who Am I Drawing Assignment?

### Core Assignment 53 - Self Reflection 5

For this week’s self-reflection you will share your thoughts about the College Prep Program! We are half-way through the program and we have LOVED getting to know you and your dreams. Your CPP family of leads, coaches, and mentors are here to help and give you a great summer experience. But we want to know what YOU think so that we can best shape the rest of the program.

Please write a 1.5-page (minimum, you are welcome to write more) answering the following questions:

- How much do you feel like you have learned since our first college prep class? Give us some examples.
- Which portions of the program do you like best? Feel free to discuss what you like best and also what is helping you the most. (Sometimes we don’t like things that are really helpful...so feel free to explain!)
- How do you feel college prep could help you even more? Feel free to discuss questions that you STILL have about college (or beyond), careers, dreams, etc. We may have covered a few things that are still not clear to you (or maybe we haven’t gotten to something you were hoping that we would), so feel free to let us know.
- Are you having fun? In class or with coaches and mentors, or through other activities? Let us know how we could make the program more fun.
- How is your interaction with your SAT coach and mentor? Please share and let us know what you like or if there is anything that would make this part of the program better for you.
- Is there anything else you’d like to share with us? Please do! If there is anything that would make the process better for you, we want to know!
