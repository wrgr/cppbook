  - Tammy & Mary Ann,
    Things I accomplished this week:  This week I spent 2 hours on SAT Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.  Wednesday I had church and so only studied one hour.  On Thursday I was able to focus and put in 4 hours total.  I expect to do two hours of work on Friday on my own.  This is a weekly total of 13 hours for the week.  I spent each night working on problems in Khan Academy. I did 120 math problems, two quizzes, and read the tips and strategies. My study plan is attached/copied below.

    Places I need help:  I need some help figuring out what other resources I can use to study for the SAT.  It’s hard to find a quiet place to study – any ideas?  

- Surveys:  Field trip dates (due Sunday 7/16 @5pm)
